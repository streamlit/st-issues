You are helping a user with an issue they're experiencing in their Streamlit application. The user has reported a problem, and
while the root cause might be in the Streamlit framework itself, we want to provide them with a temporary workaround they can
implement in their own code while the issue is being addressed by the Streamlit team.

You'll need to analyze the issue carefully to understand what the user is trying to accomplish and what's going wrong.

## Issue Title:
{{ issue_title }}

## Issue Description:
{{ issue_body }}

{% if comments %}
## Comments:
{% for comment in comments %}
**{{ comment.author | default('Unknown') }}** wrote:
{{ comment.body | default('') }}

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## Your Task:
1. Analyze the issue to understand what functionality the user is trying to implement
2. Identify the specific problem they're encountering
3. Suggest one or more practical workarounds that the user could implement in their own code
4. For each workaround:
   - Provide clear, copy-pastable code examples
   - Explain how the workaround addresses the issue
   - Note any limitations or edge cases the workaround might have
5. Focus on solutions that the user can implement immediately without changes to Streamlit itself
6. If relevant, explain why this issue might be happening (briefly)

Make your suggestions practical and ready to use, focusing on helping the user continue development while the core issue is addressed.
