## Remaining Action Items

### 1. Documentation Issue ⏸️ **AWAITING DOCS MAINTAINER RESPONSE**

**Issue:** The `st.selectbox` documentation is misleading.

**Current Documentation:**

> "Returns: The selected option or None if no option is selected."

**Actual Behavior:**

> Returns a **copy** of the selected option (deepcopy), not the original object

**Action Needed:**

- Create a documentation issue to clarify that `st.selectbox` returns copies of objects
- Waiting for docs maintainer to confirm preferred process for creating docs issues

**Details:**

- This affects users working with object identity (singletons, caching, etc.)
- Users reasonably expect object identity to be preserved based on current docs
- Documentation should either:
  - State that copies are returned
  - Add guidance on working with object identity
  - Explain workarounds (using indices instead of objects)

### 2. Relationship to Issue #3703 🔗

**Decision Needed:** Should this be closed as duplicate?

**Context:**

- Issue #3703 (2021) reported the exact same problem
- #3703 was converted to `type:enhancement` in 2023 by @jrieke
- #3703 is still open with no progress for 4+ years

**Considerations:**

- #12585 adds minimal new technical information
- Main addition: documentation discrepancy point
- Issue reporter acknowledged they're "re-upping" the old bug

**Options:**

1. Close #12585 as duplicate of #3703
2. Keep both open and link them
3. Close #3703 and use #12585 as the primary tracker
4. Reconsider the "enhancement" classification and treat as bug

### 3. Team Decision Required 🤔

**Core Question:** Is this a bug or expected behavior?

**Historical Context:**

- Was a **regression** in Streamlit 0.84 (worked in 0.83)
- Team explained deepcopy needed for session_state callback mechanisms
- Marked as "enhancement" (expected behavior) in 2023
- No progress in 2+ years since

**Team Needs to Decide:**

- Should this be reconsidered as a bug given documentation discrepancy?
- Is there appetite to add opt-out mechanism for copying?
- Should we just fix documentation and keep as expected behavior?

## Summary

**What We Accomplished:**

- ✅ Reproduction app created with workaround demonstration
- ✅ Comprehensive analysis documented in NOTES.md
- ✅ Issue closed as duplicate of #3703
- ✅ Workaround shared with community in both issues
- ✅ Identified documentation improvement need

**Outcome:**

- Issue correctly classified as enhancement (not blocking)
- Clean workaround always available (key pattern)
- Documentation improvement remains as action item

## Next Steps (Pending Docs Maintainer)

1. **Wait for docs maintainer response** on process for creating docs issue
2. **Create docs issue** once process confirmed to address:
   - Clarify that st.selectbox returns copies
   - Show key pattern for object identity
   - Explain why copying is needed (session_state callbacks)
