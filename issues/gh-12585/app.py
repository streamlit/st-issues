Reproduction for GitHub Issue #12585
Title: Selectboxes return copies and not actual selection
Issue URL: https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12585

Description:
st.selectbox returns a copy of the selected object rather than the actual object
from the options list. This breaks identity checks (using 'is' operator) and can
be problematic when working with singletons or when object identity matters.

Expected Behavior:
st.selectbox should return the exact same object instance that was provided in
the options list.

Actual Behavior:
st.selectbox returns a copy of the selected object, which fails identity checks
even though the values are equal.

Note: This issue was originally reported in 2021 (#3703) but hasn't been resolved.

**Expected:**
- The `selected` object should be identical to one of the original objects (ex1 or ex2)
- Identity check with `is` operator should return `True`
- Memory addresses should match

**Actual:**
- The `selected` object is a copy with a different memory address
- Identity check with `is` operator returns `False`
- This breaks patterns that rely on object identity (singletons, caching, etc.)
