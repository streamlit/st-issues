Reproduction for GitHub Issue #12607
Title: After File Upload the file stays in RAM
Issue URL: https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12607

Description:
When uploading files with st.file_uploader, the file remains in RAM even after
the upload is processed and clear_on_submit is set to True. The RAM is only
freed when the Streamlit instance is completely closed.

Expected Behavior:
After file upload and processing, the file should be removed from RAM when
clear_on_submit=True or when the uploader widget is cleared.

Actual Behavior:
- RAM usage increases during upload (as expected)
- After upload completion, file remains in RAM (~660MB for a 600MB file)
- Closing browser tab doesn't free the RAM
- Only closing the Streamlit instance frees the memory

Note: The workaround is to NOT use clear_on_submit and manually clear the
file using the X button in the widget.

**To reproduce this issue:**
1. Monitor RAM usage before uploading (use Task Manager / Activity Monitor)
2. Upload a large file (>100MB recommended)
3. Click "Process File"
4. Observe RAM usage stays high even after processing
5. Close the browser tab - RAM usage still high
6. Only closing Streamlit completely frees the RAM

**Expected:**
