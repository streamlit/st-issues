Reproduction for GitHub Issue #12716
Title: Long dialog starts at the bottom
Issue URL: https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12716

Description:
When a dialog has enough content to require a scrollbar, it starts scrolled to the
bottom instead of the top. Users must scroll up to see the first entries.

Expected Behavior:
Dialog should start at the top, showing the first content.

Actual Behavior:
Dialog starts scrolled to the bottom, showing the last content.
