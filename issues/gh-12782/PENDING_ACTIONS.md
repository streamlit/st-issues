# Pending Actions for Issue #12782

## Status: Unable to Reproduce

Despite multiple attempts to create a reproduction that matches the reporter's description, the bug is **not reproducing** in the test app.

## What Was Tested

### Attempt 1: Clearing Widget Key

- Parent `on_change` clears the multiselect's widget key
- **Result:** Bug did not reproduce - defaults worked correctly

### Attempt 2: Options Change Without Clearing

- Parent changes cause options to change
- Widget key persists with OLD values
- Separate session state key holds defaults
- Multiselect has `on_change` callback
- **Result:** Bug did not reproduce - multiselect correctly falls back to defaults

### Attempt 3: Fix Reproduction Logic (Current)

- **Critical fix:** Changed to only initialize `selected_conversation` once (on first load)
- Previously was updating it every fragment run, which masked the bug
- Now `selected_conversation` keeps OLD values when patient changes
- This properly tests if `default` parameter works when it has invalid values
- **Result:** Testing in progress

### Attempt 4: Python Version Testing (Skipped)

- Initially added Pipfile for Python 3.12 (reporter used 3.12.9)
- Removed to allow testing on community cloud first
- Can add back later if bug only reproduces on Python 3.12

## Observed Behavior

When testing with Patient A ‚Üí Patient B transition:

- ‚úÖ Widget key correctly shows old value: `['Initial Consultation']`
- ‚úÖ Warning correctly displayed: "Widget key contains values from OLD options"
- ‚úÖ Default source key has correct value: `['Emergency Visit']`
- ‚úÖ **Multiselect correctly displays the default value**
- ‚úÖ No empty state observed

## Possible Explanations

1. **Bug Already Fixed:** The issue may have been fixed after 1.50.0 was released
2. **Missing Crucial Element:** There's some aspect of the reporter's complex setup we haven't captured:
   - More complex conditional logic
   - Nested fragments
   - Specific timing of state updates
   - Other widgets/state interactions
3. **Version-Specific:** Might require exact version 1.50.0 (not 1.50.x or later)
4. **Expected Behavior:** The behavior the reporter observed might actually be expected in some edge cases

## Reporter's Own Statement

From the issue:

> "Unfortunately, I couldn't reproduce the issue in a minimal code snippet ‚Äî so it seems related to a more complex interaction between fragments, nested state logic, and conditional UI loading."

The reporter themselves couldn't create a minimal reproduction, which suggests this is a very specific/complex interaction.

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Request More Information

Comment on the issue asking for:

- Exact Streamlit version (1.50.0, 1.50.1, etc.)
- More complete code example that reproduces the issue
- Whether the issue still occurs in latest version
- Steps to reproduce in their actual app

### Option 2: Wait for Clarification

Since reporter says they have a workaround, wait to see if:

- Other users report the same issue
- Reporter can provide more details
- Issue reproduces in other contexts

### Option 3: Mark as Unable to Reproduce

Add comment explaining:

- Multiple reproduction attempts made
- Bug does not occur in test scenarios
- Request reporter provide reproduction that demonstrates the issue
- Keep issue open for further investigation

## Recommended Action

**Comment on issue with reproduction link and request for additional details:**

"Thank you for reporting this issue! üôè

I've created a reproduction app to investigate this:

[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://issues.streamlit.app/?issue=gh-12782)

However, I'm unable to reproduce the bug you described. The multiselect correctly falls back to the default values even when:

- The widget is inside a fragment
- Options change due to parent widget changes
- The widget key contains old values that don't exist in new options
- Defaults come from a separate session state key

Since you mentioned you couldn't reproduce it in a minimal example yourself, this suggests it may require very specific conditions. Could you help provide:

1. **Exact Streamlit version:** Is it specifically 1.50.0, or 1.50.x?
2. **Still occurring?** Does this still happen in the latest Streamlit version?
3. **More complete example:** Can you share a more complete code example that demonstrates the issue?
4. **Reproduction steps:** Specific steps in your app that trigger the bug?

In the meantime, your workaround should continue to work:

````python
st.session_state[_key] = st.session_state.selected_conversation
```"

**Label:** Remove `status:needs-triage`, add `status:awaiting-response`
