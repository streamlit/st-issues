# Issue #12815 - MultiselectColumn with Dynamic Rows Error

**GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/12815

**Reporter:** @Motunrayo244

**Created:** 2025-10-18

**Status:** Bug Confirmed - Reproduction App Created

---

## Issue Summary

When using `st.data_editor` with `st.column_config.MultiselectColumn` and dynamic rows enabled (`num_rows="dynamic"`), adding a new row and selecting values from the multiselect column causes a ValueError.

**Error Message:**
```
ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. 
The requested array has an inhomogeneous shape after 1 dimensions. 
The detected shape was (2,) + inhomogeneous part.
```

---

## Root Cause Analysis

**Location:** `lib/streamlit/elements/widgets/data_editor.py`, lines 379 and 385

**Function:** `_apply_row_additions()`

**Problem:** The function uses bulk row assignment:
```python
df.loc[index, :] = new_row
```

When `new_row` contains both scalar values (from CheckboxColumn) and list values (from MultiselectColumn), pandas cannot create a homogeneous numpy array, causing the error.

## Visual Reproduction App

**File:** `app.py`

**Created:** 2025-10-20

**Purpose:** Visual demonstration of issue #12815 for manual verification

**App Features:**

- ✅ Demonstrates bug clearly with visual indicators
- ✅ Shows buggy data editor with dynamic rows (triggers error)
- ✅ Shows workaround using fixed rows (works but limited)
- ✅ Includes detailed technical explanation
- ✅ Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- ✅ Links to original issue
- ✅ Self-contained and immediately runnable

**Testing Notes:**

To reproduce the bug:
1. Click the "+ Add row" button in the first data editor
2. Select one or more categories from the MultiselectColumn
3. Observe the ValueError that appears

The bug is **consistent and reproducible** with any combination of:
- MultiselectColumn (list values)
- Any other column type with scalar values (CheckboxColumn, TextColumn, NumberColumn, etc.)
- Dynamic rows enabled

**Deploy URL:** https://issues.streamlit.app/?issue=gh-12815
(Available after deployment)

## Minimal Reproduction Code

```python
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

data_df = pd.DataFrame({
    "category": [
        ["exploration", "visualization"],
        ["llm", "visualization"],
        ["exploration"],
    ],
    "is_active": [True, True, True],
})

st.data_editor(
    data_df,
    hide_index=True,
    num_rows="dynamic",
    column_config={
        "category": st.column_config.MultiselectColumn(
            "App Categories",
            options=["exploration", "visualization", "llm"],
        ),
        "is_active": st.column_config.CheckboxColumn("Active"),
    },
)
```

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Run the code above
2. Click "+ Add row"
3. Select any category in the new row
4. Error appears

## Impact Assessment

**Severity:** Medium-High

- Completely blocks dynamic row addition when using MultiselectColumn with other column types
- No workaround that maintains dynamic functionality
- Affects common use case (editable tables with categories/tags)

**Scope:**
- Any `st.data_editor` with `num_rows="dynamic"`
- Combined with `MultiselectColumn` and any other column type

**Affected Versions:** 1.50.0 (confirmed), likely affects earlier versions

---

## Proposed Solution

Replace bulk row assignment with column-by-column assignment in `_apply_row_additions()`:

```python
# Instead of:
df.loc[index, :] = new_row

# Use:
for col_idx, value in enumerate(new_row):
    df.iloc[index, col_idx] = value
```

Or use pandas methods that handle mixed types correctly.
